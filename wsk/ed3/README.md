- Sheet 62 Heerlen mentions the top and left side in Cartesian: x := +35_000, y := -138_000 This seems to be Rijksdriehoekstelsel 'oud' centered on Amersfoort Lievevrouwekerk = (0, 0). Other sheets also have x / y in the rim (left and top, e.g. 42 Zierikzee Oost), but not all of them, 's Gravenhage Oost 30, also has this on it
- The sheet can be placed on the sheet on the left, in the mid and in the center, which columns of text next to it (either at other end 2 columns, or at both ends 1 column)
- There are some sheets (in the south) where the size of the sheet is a bit bigger than what is on all others (e.g. 60 Sittard), some are a bit smaller (e.g. 62 Heerlen, 41 Aalten Oost)
- The grid is 2x2 cm, with a map scale of 1:50k this means 1 km in the terrain
- With some coloured polygons, the small interior line might be difficult to read (e.g. sheet 12 Assen Oost)

- 42 Zierikzee Oost has 2 sheets on them (also a small scale map showing overview where 'hoofdwaterkeringen' are)
- Denekamp 29 has 2 sheets ? Or a part that is in German territory
- Sheets seem to be 20 km width x 25 km height
